# Red Dock
Red Dock is a Linux tool designed for managing Docker, facilitating the installation and utilization of Docker specifically tailored for penetration testing purposes.
---
## Why opt for this tool?
- The primary goal of Red Dock is to furnish penetration testers with a pre-configured Kali Linux environment containing a comprehensive set of popular tools and frameworks.
- The tool includes a Python script designed to streamline the management of Docker containers, eliminating the need for cumbersome Docker commands.
- Kali is the default image due to its Custom Package Repositories, simplifying the installation of additional tools not initially included.
- It resolves the perennial dilemma faced by novice hackers on whether to use a virtual machine (VM) or dual boot by advocating for Dockerâ€”faster than a VM and equally secure.
---
## Prerequisites
- Docker must be installed on your system.
- If Docker is not installed, refer to the official Docker installation guide: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
---
## Installation Instructions for Ubuntu/Debian
Execute the `install.sh` script to initiate the automated installation process.
```bash
./install.sh
```
---
## Usage

### Launch Kali Linux Container

```bash
./rd.sh start
```
This command initiates the Kali Linux Docker container while also establishing a volume for persistence.

### Halt Kali Linux Container

```bash
./rd.sh stop
```
Cease and remove the actively running Kali Linux Docker container.

### Check Container Status

```bash
./rd.sh status
```
View the status of Docker containers.

### Update Kali Linux Image

```bash
./rd.sh update
```
Update the Kali Linux Docker image by committing changes from the running container.

### Transfer Files to/from Container

```bash
./rd.sh cp <file-from-container> <path-to-copy>
```
Facilitate file transfer between the Kali Linux Docker container and the host machine.

### Connect to Container

```bash
./rd.sh attach
```
Connect to the running Kali Linux Docker container. If the container is not running, it will be initiated automatically.
